    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I received my Bachelor's from University of Florida in Computer Engineering Software, and I am currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Science at UF. I grew up in Panama City, Florida and went to Mosley High School. My interests include: Computer security, networking, prorgramming, genetic algorithms, statistics (casino games in particular),video games (mostly PC), and anything outdoors.    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I am currently a teaching assistant at the University of Florida. I have been playing tennis for 14 years. I was the UF Club Tennis President for two years, and I'm still a part of the UF Club Tennis team. I recently just started rock climbing at the Gainesville Rock Gym. If you're interested in my work experience and skills, the &quot;LinkedIn&quot; link above  contains all of that information and more. If you're interested in looking at some of my projects (both professional and personal) you can click the &quot;Projects&quot; link at the top of the page.</p>
